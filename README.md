PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR E-COMMERCE PLATFORM

 E-commerce platforms websites capture a huge amount
 of data about user interactions, and quality product recom
mendations are essential for better user experiences and to
 drive more sales. Changes in consumer demands and interests
 cannot always be adapted to by just sticking with static
 top-performing recommendation algorithms. The solution is
 a recommendation system driven by machine learning using
 Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid
 Filtering to correctly recommend relevant suggestions. This
 project is focused on building an intelligent recommendation
 system that entails collecting and cleaning data from open
 publicly available databases or real-time sources, feature engi
neering potential useful attributes, and designing and feeding
 this data to different machine learning models to tune and
 maximize system performance.
